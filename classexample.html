           Meerkats exhibit a variety of sensory modalities that show their adaptability to a harsh environment. They practice scent marking, which serves several functions such as distinguishing family members and marking territory. This is achieved through cheek marking, which is often for group members, and anal marking. Wastes, urine, and saliva are also some common forms of marking territory. The dark circles around the meerkat’s eyes function to provide better vision by deflecting sun rays and also enlarge the eyes to appear threatening. This enables the meerkat to see predatory birds from above despite the blaring rays of the sun (2). Meerkats also have strong forearms, which are used to burrow into the ground quickly and kick up dust clouds as a diversion for predators. Combined with their non-retractable front claws, they dig for their prey, such as insects, as most of their food is found underground. Their small, round, dark ears are set close to their head and can close to prevent debris from entering while burrowing. Meerkats are farsighted, meaning their eyes can’t focus clearly on objects too close to them, but they have a strong sense of smell to compensate for this (3).

         The first rule of brainstorming is: </center>
         <ol>
           <li>Do not erase or delete anything.</li>
           <li>Try to expand on every idea, regardless of whether it is ‘relevant’.</li>
